% Problem  : Clauses from a labelled graph
% Version  : Especial.
% English  : Consider a graph with the edges labelled. For example
%                          *       :
%                      A /   \ B   :
%                       *--C--*    :
%                      D \   / E   :
%                          *       :
%            Assign 0 or 1 arbitarily to nodes of the graph. For each node
%            of the graph, we associate a set of clauses as follows :
%            (1) Every label of an edge emanating from that node will
%                occur in each clause (of the set of clauses generated
%                from that node).
%            (2) If the node is assigned 0, then the number of negated
%                literals in each of the generated clauses is to be odd.
%                Generate all such clauses for that node.
%            (3) If the node is assigned 1, then the number of negated
%                literals in each of the generated clauses is to be even.
%                Generate all such clauses for that node.
%            Tseitin's result is this: the sum (mod 2) of the 0's and 1's
%            assigned to the nodes of the graph equals 1 iff the set
%            of generated clauses is inconsistent. For example, if the top
%            node of the above graph is assigned 1, and all other nodes
%            0, then the set of generated clauses will be inconsistent.

% Comments : There is a graph which can be used to produce a problem
%            equivalent to Pelletier 71. This is described in Pelletier 74.
